# Digital Signatures – Web Learning Module

This project is a simple educational webpage designed to help students better understand key topics in **Data Security**, specifically **Digital Signatures** and their role in modern cryptography.

## 📚 Purpose

The content was extracted and adapted from the official course sheet (`Digital_Sign_Sheet_9.docx`) and transformed into an interactive web format to:

- Enhance the student learning experience
- Provide a digital, easy-to-navigate summary of critical cryptographic concepts
- Act as a revision tool for quizzes, midterms, or finals

## 🔍 Topics Covered

- Key Features: Authenticity, Integrity, Non-repudiation
- Third-party authentication and Certificate Authorities (CA)
- Limitations of digital signatures and expiration dates
- Signature security and potential attacks:
  - Key-only Attack
  - Known Message Attack
  - Chosen Message Attacks (Generic, Directed, Adaptive)
- Types of Forgeries (Total, Universal, Selective, Existential)
- Comparison between Direct and Arbitrated Digital Signatures
- Order of operations for signature + encryption
- Summary review questions and answers
